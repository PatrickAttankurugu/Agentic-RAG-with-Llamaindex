# Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex

## Overview
Welcome to the Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex project! This repository contains the code and resources for building advanced research agents using the Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework, powered by LlamaIndex. This project is part of a course by DeepLearning.AI, designed to help you develop agents capable of sophisticated tool use, research, and decision-making.

## What is Agentic RAG?
Agentic RAG is an innovative approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems and generative models. By leveraging these two methodologies, Agentic RAG enables the creation of intelligent agents that can:
- Retrieve relevant information from vast data sources.
- Generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
- Perform complex reasoning and decision-making tasks.

### Key Features
1. **Intelligent Assistance**: Enhances conversational AI by understanding and maintaining context.
2. **Research Capabilities**: Synthesizes information from multiple documents, aiding in scientific exploration and hypothesis generation.
3. **Content Generation**: Assists in creating high-quality, relevant content for various domains.
4. **Educational Tools**: Personalizes learning experiences by adapting to individual needs.
5. **Healthcare Support**: Assists healthcare professionals with access to a vast repository of medical knowledge.
6. **Legal Compliance**: Streamlines legal research and ensures compliance with regulations.

## Why Use Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex?
LlamaIndex is a powerful data framework that supports the development of Large Language Model (LLM) applications. When combined with Agentic RAG, it offers several advantages:
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: LlamaIndex provides robust data connectors, making it easy to ingest and manage data from various sources like APIs, PDFs, and SQL databases.
- **Tool Use and Reasoning**: Agentic RAG enables agents to use tools effectively, making them capable of complex multi-step reasoning.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale with additional sub-agents, enhancing the system's capabilities over time.

## Course Highlights
This repository is part of a learning journey that includes:
- Building basic agents that can select relevant documents based on user queries.
- Developing router agents for tasks like Q&A and summarization.
- Extending research agents to handle multiple documents.
- Debugging and controlling agents to ensure accurate and efficient performance.
